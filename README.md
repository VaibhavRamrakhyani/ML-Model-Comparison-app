Machine Learning Model Comparison Web App
Overview
This project is a machine learning model comparison web app developed using Python, Streamlit, and Lazypredict. The goal of the app is to simplify the process of comparing and selecting the most suitable machine learning model for a given dataset. It achieves this by automatically training and evaluating 30 distinct machine learning models and providing a comprehensive report on their performance.

Features
Model Comparison: The app allows users to input their dataset, and it automatically trains and evaluates 30 different machine learning models. This enables users to compare the performance of various models on their specific dataset.

Detailed Report: The app generates a detailed report on model performance, emphasizing key error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the time taken for training each model.

Graphical Visualizations: To enhance the understanding of model performance, the app provides graphical visualizations such as bar charts. These visualizations intuitively showcase the accuracy and training time of each model, making it easier for data scientists to interpret the results.

Empowering Data Scientists: By simplifying the model selection process, the web app empowers data scientists to make informed decisions efficiently. This contributes to enhancing transparency in the model evaluation process and enables users to choose the most appropriate model for their specific use case.
